# Build a Multi Layer Perceptron from Scratch for Material Type Detection in APEX Data
This work was a part of a machine learning course I took during my Semester at the VUB in 2017. 
The course is given by Ann Now√© and Hugues Bersini. This notebook is a slightly adapte form of 
the work I did for the final project of this course. It takes former created ground truth 
data information and uses it as an input to train and test a multi layer perceptron 
(Courtesy to Frederik PRIEM who created the ground truth data). 
The code is heavily inspired by the tutorial 
"[implementing a neural network from scratch](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/)" by Dennie Britz. 
It is strongly recommended to also read his post to understand of what is going on.
